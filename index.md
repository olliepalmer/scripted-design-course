This course aims to immerse students in the processes and techniques of film-based visual storytelling, whilst introducing students to Oulipian-inspired constrained design processes.

All materials are open access and open source, so anybody is free to take the content and use it in their own practice. Students retain ownership and copyright of their own work.
