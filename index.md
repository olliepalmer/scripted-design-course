This course aims to immerse students in the processes and techniques of film-based visual storytelling, whilst introducing students to Oulipian-inspired constrained design processes.

The 2026 course consists of classes where we meet up in person, which are supplemented by a [podcast series](/2026/classes), with 3 episodes per week, each containing guided exercises for you to do in your own time. All materials are open access and open source, so anybody is free to take the content of this course and use it in their own practice. Please note, students retain ownership and copyright of their own work.
