## This is the course website with all of the course documentation, exercises, etc. New activities will be uploaded each week, and we'll upload a lot of our work here.


This course is open access and open source, so anybody is free to take the content and use it in their own practice. Students retain ownership and copyright of their own work.

New content is coming soon. Watch this space!

Last years' course is available [here](/2019), and the student-curated exhibition is available [here]()
