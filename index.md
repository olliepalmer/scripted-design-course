You can take this course in two ways:

- As a guest - most of the teaching on the course is open-access via this website and the course podcast. There are three podcast episodes with structured creative activities, which build towards two projects. You can take the course at the pace that you like, and dip into and out of it as you wish.
- As a student of Situated Design, Visual Culture, or Ecological Futures at MIVC - the module carries 3EC credits, and runs from September 25-December 11, 2020. You must be enrolled to participate in these classes, and you will need to complete the exercises as they are released each week.

This course is open access and open source, so anybody is free to take the content and use it in their own practice. Students retain ownership and copyright of their own work.

New content is coming soon. Watch this space!

Last years' course is available [here](/2019), and the student-curated exhibition is available [here]()
