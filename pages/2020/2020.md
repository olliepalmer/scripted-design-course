> *Still from [Network/Intersect](https://olliepalmer.com/network-intersect) (dir. Ollie Palmer, 2016)*

This course immerses students in the processes and techniques of film-based visual storytelling, whilst introducing students to Oulipian-inspired constrained design processes.

Over the course of ten weeks, students make a series of short films, guided by rules that they create. Over time, both rules and films increase in length and complexity. For the initial films, students are assigned a subject matter, and have to devise a set of rules to shape the film they make. For example, students making a film about gravity might decide that the camera must always be moving downward, or swinging from a pendulum, or can only be made whilst the camera operator is falling over, etc.

The students make a series of these extremely short films both in class and in their own time, then present to, and provide feedback to their peers. This is intended to enable students not to be precious about the presentation of filmic work; the legibility of the rules used to create the films will be more important than the outcome of the films themselves. The films become a visual diary of constrained design processes. It also ensures that there is a substantial body of work (10-15 very short films per student).

Later this same process is expanded; students work in small groups to devise rules, and write, produce, and edit short films of increased length which combine multiple subjects. Students devise a set of rules which will inform every decision they make throughout the scripting, shooting, and editing process.

Throughout the course, students must document their process, present their works-in-progress, and provide feedback to peers about processes used. The course culminates in a public screening party of all films made during the course.

The course is taught via a combination of audio podcasts (which are also transcribed) as well as weekly meetings where students discuss their work and provide feedback to one another.

Anybody is able to listen to the podcasts and access course materials via this website. However, only students of the course at MIVC will have access to the weekly classes, feedback, and catch-up sessions, and be assessed on 11 December 2020.

# Course guidelines


## Teaching and participation

Formal tuition is taught via podcast. There are eight weeks of formal classes, with three podcast episodes released per week. Each episode lasts up to 20 minutes, and most activities can be done in real-time. During weeks 3-4 you will be learning film editing, so it may take you a little longer.

If you are enrolled in the course at MIVC, you will be expected to upload work from the exercises in time for each class.

You are also expected to make one short film per day throughout this course. This may sound like a lot, but each film should only take you a couple of minutes to make. At the end of the course we'll be compiling your 'daily films' into one body of work.

This course is performed in public. All of the exercises we're doing are publicly accessible on this website. Over the period of this course, we will be making films and audio that we will put back into the public domain, so that anybody can use our work (with proper attribution). If for any reason you are uncomfortable with this, please contact the course tutor, [Dr. Ollie Palmer](#tutor).

If you are not enrolled at MIVC and would also like to contribute, please contact me.

Each week we will meet on a Zoom call, where we will discuss the weeks' activities and review each others' work. We will be using the following technologies to communicate:

- [Our podcast](https://anchor.fm/scripteddesign), for all classes. You can listen to them on any we-connected device, and subscribe via the app which suits you best. Podcast episodes are also transcribed via this website, so that if you need to read rather than listen, or if you'd like to translate into another language, you can.
- [Zoom](https://zoom.us) to speak to each other. You'll be sent a new Zoom link each week if you are enrolled in the course.
- [Miro](https://miro.com) to share and review each others' work.
- [Google Forms](https://forms.google.com), to upload and store work we make. This means you'll need a Google-enabled account to upload work (if you have Gmail, just use that address).
- This website, to share classes.

If you have any concerns or issues with any of this technology, please do contact me.

## Marking

Your work will be graded on 11th December 2020 by a panel consisting of your tutor and 1-2 other people. You will be awarded a grade according to the standard criteria for assessing work, namely:

- Positioning
- Methods
- Self-directed learning

If you have concerns about the marking procedure, or would like to suggest any improvements, please contact me.

## Inclusivity

This course is designed to further your creativity and allow you to explore new ideas, techniques, and concepts.

In order to do this, we need to make sure that everybody feels able to express themselves in a safe environment. At AKV St Joost we embrace an atmosphere of creativity which is enriched and enhanced by diversity along a number of dimensions, including race, ethnicity and national origins, gender and gender identity, sexuality, class and religion. We are especially committed to increasing the representation of those populations which have historically been excluded from participation in Dutch higher education.

It is critical that each class member show respect for all world-views expressed in class. If you feel that something said or done in class is troubling or has caused discomfort, please contact Ollie confidentially. If you would like to speak to someone outside of the classroom, please contact Study Coach [Rosie Heinrich](https://www.akvstjoostmasters.nl/community/tutors/rosie-heinrich).

If you have a name or pronoun which differs from the one we have on record, please let me know. Like many people, I am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities, and am always eager to hear from students how I can improve in this respect.

If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please speak to Ollie or Rosie. Ollie is also available for individual tutorials on Fridays outside of class for students across MIVC.

## Assessment criteria

You will be assessed at the end of the course on the following:

- *1 film or mixed-media presentation consisting of your 'daily videos'* _40%_  
Student has produced a high quality film or mixed-media presentation demonstrating that they have:
  -	followed the procedure of making at least one rules-based video per day, leading to a body of work to draw from  
  -	curated and assembled this body of work into a coherent film or mixed-media presentation which shows the breadth and variety of their videos.  
The presentation will show the films in a mode which is appropriate for their subject matter, with a visual coherence and editing suitable for the content.

- *2-3 short experimental ‘sketch’ films, made individually / in groups* _40%_
You can demonstrate that you have followed rules laid out in class, or self-created rules, to create 2-3 experimental ‘sketch’ films to a high standard, with care and attention given to the genre, subject, editing, and mis-en-scene of the films.

- *Documentation and description of process, to be presented in graphic and verbal format. This presentation is the means by which the students’ understanding of the module’s content and their own work within it.* _20%_  
You are able to present a structured and logical overview of their work, and the processes, methods, and theories you have used to create their work, as well as critical reflections on your own practice. The presentation should utilise appropriate audiovisual methods (for example a Powerpoint presentation, a scripted performance, etc) to deliver its message.
