<a id="rdmfile" class="button" onclick="document.getElementById('rdmfile').href = getRndInteger(1,137)" download>Download random memory</a>

<script type="text/javascript">
function getRndFile() {
  var files = ["the_arrow_and_the_song__by__sixin.mp3","i_did_it!__by__anonymous.mp3","summer_in_böste__by__clara.mp3","beachhouse__by__joris.mp3","the_last_night__by__valeria.mp3","a_magical_5th_of_december__by__famke.mp3","the_caravan__by__niké.mp3","audio_file_w03302__by__mohammad.mp3","the_netherlands_and_i__by__scienthya.mp3","last_summer__by__linsey_kuijpers.mp3","roof__by__linda.mp3","sleep__by__berendine_venemans.mp3","neighbor__by__nasrin.mp3","running_over_bridges__by__pam.mp3","first_memory__by__anonymous.mp3"]
	var file = files[Math.floor(Math.random()*files.length)]
  var clicker = 'onclick="document.getElementById(\'rdmfile\').href = getRndFile()"';
	var text = "/assets/60s-memories/"+file;
    return text;
