# Class rules

These are some guidelines for this course, as heard in [the Introduction episode](https://sd.olliepalmer.com/2020/classes/w00e00#course-rules) of the podcast.

1. We will shoot in 16:9, landscape format. You can edit your footage into other formats later, but start in this format. This means if you’re shooting on a phone, you hold it in horizontally!
2. We write, shoot, and edit fast. We are not precious about showing our work, or work-in-progress. We acknowledge it’s not going to be perfect, and constructive criticism will make it better.
3. We make something small every day. It doesn’t have to be great: it just has to be made.
4. We share our work with each other.
5. Rules help us make things.
6. If in doubt, make.
7. Ask for feedback. Ask colleagues, peers, friends. Asking for and giving feedback is one of the best things you can do creatively – mostly because it forces you to formulate ideas and explain things in a way which makes sense for other people.
