## Course information

We read through the [course information](/2020/about) together, making sure that everyone was well informed about their expectations for the course.

## Drawing exercise

We did a brief drawing exercise:

- Take one fresh sheet of paper
- Make five marks on the paper, in any manner you like
- Draw a line around each of the five marks, keeping an even distance from the mark itself
- Draw a line around the new outline, keeping an even distance from the line itself
- Repeat until your page is full.

Here are the images that were made in class:

Why did we do this exercise? Two reasons:

1. The process is a small example of what we're going to be doing throughout this course, making arbitrary decisions about constraints and amplifying them until they are part of our work
2. To practice working quickly and uploading to the Miro board we'll use in classes to share and critique work

## Daily film rules

We left deciding on a set of constraints that we'd commit to for making a short film every day of this course. There is more detail on this in the podcast episode coming soon.
