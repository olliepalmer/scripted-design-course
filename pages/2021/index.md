This course aims to immerse students in the processes and techniques of film-based visual storytelling, whilst introducing students to Oulipian-inspired constrained design processes.

This course is open access and open source, so anybody is free to take the content and use it in their own practice. Students retain ownership and copyright of their own work.

Over the course of ten weeks, students make a series of short films, guided by rules that they create. Over time, both rules and films increase in length and complexity. The course is taught via podcasts, which contain structured creative exercises, and for MIVC students there are also classes, which are taught online. All podcast episodes are also transcribed, so they can be read as well as listened to.

Anyone can access the podcasts and this website, but only student of Situated Design, Visual Culture, or Ecological Futures at MIVC can access in-person tuition, receive credits for taking the course, or be assessed. This module carries 3EC credits, and runs from September 25 until December 11, 2021. You must be enrolled to participate in these classes, and you will need to complete the exercises as they are released each week.

Last years' course is available [here](/2019), and the student-curated exhibition is available [here](/2019/exhibition)
