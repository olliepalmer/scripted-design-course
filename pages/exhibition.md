# Exhibition

The work of the students from this course was exhibited at V2\_ Lab of the Unstable Media on 17 December 2019 in an exhibition entitled ['Landscape Mode'](https://v2.nl/events/film-exhibition-landscape-mode-1) (named after the first constraint used on the course). The exhibition was curated by [Bregje Horsten](https://www.bregjehorsten.com), Yusuf Deniz, and [Leonardo Landoni](https://www.leonardolandoni.com).


## Landscape Mode

'LANDSCAPE MODEâ€™ is a collective Film exhibition from the Master Institute of Visual Cultures, AKV\|St. Joost that will exhibit the output of a rule-based filming of moments that took place in the last 70 days. "How can I film a different running subject every day?" and "How do I capture myself brushing my teeth every day in a different way?" are some of the personal questions that needed a daily answer while considering only one initial rule: "Keep it LANDSCAPE MODE".
