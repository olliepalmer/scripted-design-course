## Speed feedback

In class, we ran peer-to-peer speed-feedback sessions so that the wisdom of the class could be used to improve everyone's work. The technique was:

- Arrange the room so that people sit in pairs.
- Run several 10-minute sessions:
  - Person A presents their work to person B for 2 minutes. Person B provides feedback about how to improve their work for 3 minutes.
  - Person A and B then swap, so that person B presents their work for 2 minutes, and person A provides feedback for 3 minutes.
  - Make sure to write the feedback down! There will be some great ideas that you might forget.
- Keep running sessions until everyone has had feedback from 5 people.

PERSON A  | PERSON B  |  PERSON B | PERSON A
