# Cutting films


## Downloading films

You should be able to figure this out. Go to YouTube and search for the scene you want to download. Google '[how to download from youtube](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+download+from+youtube&oq=how+to+download+from+youtube)' and do it. 

## Cutting scenes

For all of my demo scenes, I will be using [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6tn6eqkI94) from [No Country For Old Men](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0477348/) (2007, dir. Joel and Ethan Coen). It's a good one to choose because it is technically simple – a confrontation between a killer and the person who was trying to track him down – and the script is online. Most of the action takes place in one room, and there are limited camera shots.

There are instructions for [Premiere Pro](#premiere-pro) and [DaVinci Resolve](#davinci-resolve).


### Premiere Pro

Open Premiere Pro. Select ```File ▶ New```



![](/assets/class-03/prem1.png)

Set up a new project somewhere on your computer. Mine is called ```no-country-for-old-men-analysis.prproj```.

![](/assets/class-03/prem2.png)

Import your film clip. Note that it's best to store your film clip in the same folder so you can find it later.

Create a new sequence. Make sure it's 1080p!

Drag your clip into the sequence. It will probably ask if you want to change the clip settings – don't! Select 'Keep existing settings'.

Scale your clip so it fits into the Program window. My clip was very low resolution so I had to make it 302% size.

Select the Razor tool (press ```C```)

Now go through the clip and cut the clip every time there is a cut in the film. You can use the arrow ⬅️➡️ keys to move frame-by-frame.

For clarity, I put the different characters on different timelines. Here, the character in black (Carson) is on video track 1, whereas the character with the cowboy hat (Anton) is on track 2.

I have also put markers (pressing ```M```) where key events happen: one in the opening shot where the Carson enters the frame for the first time; one where a phone rings; and one where Anton is killed.

Finally, **SAVE YOUR FILE!** You will need it later.

### DaVinci Resolve

The instructions are similar to Premiere Pro

Open Resolve. Select ```File ▶ New```

![](/assets/class-03/dv1.png)

Choose your project name.

![](/assets/class-03/dv2.png)

Select ```File ▶ Import Media```

![](/assets/class-03/dv3.png)

Import your film clip.

Create a new timeline. ```File ▶ New Timeline```. Make sure your settings are for 1920x1080, opt for a few video tracks.



![](/assets/class-03/dv4.png)

Now go through the clip and use the Blade tool (press ```B```), cut the clip every time there is a cut in the film. You can use the arrow ⬅️➡️ keys to move frame-by-frame.

Note that you might want to turn Snapping on (press ```N```) to make your job a little easier.

For ease of categorisation, I put all shots with Anton on one track, and all with Carson on another. I also renamed the tracks to make this clear to myself:

You should also add markers where anything significant happens in the film. In my case, I added a marker when Anton enters for the first time, one when the phone rings, and one when Anton is killed.

Finally, don't forget to **SAVE YOUR FILE!** You will need it later.
