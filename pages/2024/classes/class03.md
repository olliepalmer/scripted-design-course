## Mundane story, retold

Students took 3 minutes to write a dialogue from a recent mundane interaction they had with someone else. Examples included a conversation in the lift, the start of a phone call with a parent, and bumping into a colleague in the corridor seconds before class.

We then discussed Raynond Quineau's [Exercises in Style](https://monoskop.org/images/4/49/Queneau_Raymond_Exercises_in_Style_pp_1-26.pdf). Students rewrote their dialogue in several styles using this genre generator:

## Me vs the Spar

We briefly discussed the following podcast episode by the brilliant Ross Sutherland, which takes a story about his life, and re-tells it in seven different ways:

## Film editing

Finally, we used the following instructions to cut two films found in the [Prelinger Archives](https://archive.org/details/prelinger) to the pace of a famous scene from a film. The instructions to do this are [here](https://sd.olliepalmer.com/2019/classes/3/cutting).
